Hello, my name is Lyubomir, but you can call me Thotus for short :).

I started my coding journey about a year ago(as of 6/2/22) and have acquainted myself with the fundamentals of programming. I started off with Python, and although I'm looking to move over to JavaScript, I'm planning on fleshing out my Python skills in the near future. Having said that, my main focus for the time being is Web Developing.

I'm currently working as Tech Support in a company held by GoDaddy, so I'm looking at websites all day, every day. This is what sparked the interest for Web Development in me. I also acquainted myself with the basics of web hosting, while looking at the work of my Seniors. The job taught me how to troubleshoot common hosting issues, and along the way I picked up on some PHP and MySQL.

I'm not really looking on collaborating on anything yet. My main priority is to get a few projects of my own up-and-running.
